<h2 id="welcome">Welcome to the  2019 Edition of COMP33511! <a href="#toc" title="return to contents" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></h2>

<div class="highlight">Your exam for UX is on [updated when we know, but
 it is typically early on in the schedule] - See your exam timetable for
 full details, changes, and ammendments (this note is indicatory).</div>


<p>COMP33511 runs as a '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom" title="Definition">flipped classroom</a>'
 in that I expect you to read the notes before the lecture, and then in 
the lecture we discuss the topics covered in the notes as well as 
possible exam questions, problems you are having etc.</p>

<p>Assessment is via both coursework and examination. Coursework 
comprises three short assignments (reading and a 250 word report each) 
worth 30% total (3 x 10%). The exam is therefore worth 70% and comprises
 ten multiple choice questions and five/six longer questions. Both 
coursework and exam are completed by electronic assessment and all 
questions are compulsory.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><h3>Human Computer Interaction Society</h3>
<p>HCI Society is a group of likeminded people interested in the 
interaction between humans and all forms of information technology. We 
plan on organising our own social events, take part as a society to 
social events and hackathons, but also we encourage non computer 
scientists to join the society if they are interested in this research 
field.</p>
<h3>Social media:</h3>

<h3>User Experience</h3>
<p>Since the early days of computer science, with the move from punch 
cards to QWERTY keyboards, from “Doug Englebart's” mouse and rudimentary
 hypertext systems, via work on graphical user interfaces at Xerox PARC,
 to the desire to share information between any computer (the World Wide
 Web), the human has been at the heart of the system. Human computer 
interaction then, has had a long history in terms of computer science, 
but is relatively young as a separate subject area. In some ways, its 
study is indivisible from that of the components which it helps to make 
usable, however, as we shall, key scientific principles different from 
most other aspects of computer science, support and underlay the area; 
and by implication its practical application as UX.</p>
<p>User experience (UX or UE) is often conflated with usability but some
 would say takes its lead from the emerging discipline of experience 
design (XD). In reality, this means that usability is often thought of 
as being within the technical domain. Often being responsible for 
engineering aspects of the interface or interactive behaviour by 
building usability paradigms directly into the system. On the other hand
 user experience is meant to convey a wider remit which does not just 
primarily focus on the interface but other psychological aspects of the 
use behaviour. We’ll talk about this in more detail later, because as 
the UX field evolves, this view has become somewhat out of date.</p>

<p>This unit comprises twenty teaching sessions with one extra to cover 
revision topics, and one self revision lecture (which might also be a 
make-up lecture to cover unexpected circumstances).</p>
<p>You will be expected to devote further time for your own study and 
for the completion of your coursework (this is expected for all courses 
and is detailed in the course / programme handbook.).</p>
<p>The twenty traditional lectures will be interspersed with three 
discussions in which the material for the coursework (coursework will 
take the form of three, 250 word, discussions of key UX topics.) will be
 examined, after you have completed and submitted it for marking.</p>

<div class="highlight">All students should have feedback specifically 
targeted to what you need to do to get a better mark next time. Go to 
Turn-It-In and look at both the rhubric and the feedback. If there is no
 feedback, this is a mistake - and you should contact me so I can sort 
it out.</div>

<p>Submission Dates will be:</p>
<ul>
<li class="current">Assignment 1 - Due Semester 1 Week 02 Tuesday 16:00</li>
<li class="next">Assignment 2 - Due Semester 1 Week 07 Tuesday 16:00 </li>
<li class="later">Assignment 3 - Due Semester 1 Week 11 Tuesday 16:00</li>
</ul>
<p>We will also be having between 1 and 2 industrial talks from organisations such as the BBC, Thoughtworks, and Barclays.</p>
<p>In this case the unit is composed of discussions through: (a) the 
principles, tools, and techniques required; (b) These course notes to 
expand on those principles and techniques; (c) the discussion topics to 
teach and test your ability to summarise, and then form a view based on a
 complex UX topic<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>;
 and finally, (d) the secondary text which will hopefully teach you 
something about the general science of the area while also enabling you 
to critique areas and understand how and why your view has been formed 
(including the ability for people to have different views which may 
coexist).</p>

<p>In addition to the unit topics, there will be an unseen quiz at the 
start of each lecture, along with a discussion on a question -- based on
 the course text -- posed at the end of the preceding lecture.</p>


<h3 id="attendance">Attendance <a href="#toc" title="return to contents" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></h3>
<p>I consider that you are all adults and I will treat you as such. 
Attendance for all contact hours is entirely optional -- however from 
past years experience there is a direct correlation between students who
 attend and those who get over 56% overall.</p>

<h3 name="help">Expectations and Help <a href="#toc" title="return to contents" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></h3>
Before we get started on the real UX work let me state the kind of 
expectations I have of you, and the kind of help that you can get from 
me. My primary expectation is that you will talk to me, interact, ask 
questions, and challenge me if you think I'm wrong; in general be 
interested. Anybody interested will be able to understand this course 
and only by understanding will you be able to pass your exams.<p></p>
<p>I consider you all to be adults, attendance is therefore optional, 
however don't expect that you will be able to monopolise my `open house'
 near the end of the course if you haven't attended, contributed or put 
in some effort consistently over the full course.</p>
<p>Hopefully you will choose to attend every lecture, in this case I do 
not expect you to be asleep, reading a newspaper or some other 
magazines, be talking to your friends, or be using your mobile -- 
remember if you do not want to be at the lecture, be somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong><em>I am here to help</em></strong>, if you have any problems
 with the course itself, the work you are expected to do, problems in 
general (not course related), a need for more feedback either from your 
coursework or from the questions posed within the course lectures, or 
anything else you are not clear on, then come to see me either at the 
end of each lecture or privately in my <a href="#l-contact">'open house'</a>
 sessions. If you feel you need more help, if I can't help you, or if 
you do not feel comfortable talking to me (maybe because you have a 
problem with my teaching) then you can talk in confidence with your 
personal tutor, or your third-year supervisor. If these tutors cannot 
help you, then you can talk -- again in confidence -- to the Head of 
Year<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>, or the Director of Undergraduate Studies<sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong><em>We are all here to help</em></strong> whatever happens do not sit on a problem, the sooner we know there is a problem the sooner we can help you address it:</p>

<h2 id="cw">Coursework Assignments <a href="#toc" title="return to contents" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></h2>
<p>These discussion topics are provided to help you form your opinion 
about a certain aspect of UX which needs closer inspection, while at the
 same time teaching you how to read, summarise, and critique<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup> a piece of work such that you can form your own opinions about that work.</p>

<h3 id="plagiarism">A Note on Plagiarism <a href="#toc" title="return to contents" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></h3>
<p>Both the School and University take plagiarism very seriously, in the
 context of your coursework let us just revisit what this actually 
means. Plagiarism is presenting the ideas, work or words of other people
 without proper, clear and unambiguous acknowledgement. It also includes
 self-plagiarism (which occurs where, for example, you submit work that 
you have presented for assessment on a previous occasion), and the 
submission of material from essay banks (even if the authors of such 
material appear to be giving you permission to use it in this way). 
Obviously, the most blatant example of plagiarism would be to copy 
another students work. Hence it is essential to make clear in your work 
the distinction between: the ideas and work of other people that you may
 have quite legitimately exploited and developed, and the ideas or 
material that you have personally contributed. To assist you, here are a
 few important dos and don'ts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Do get lots of background information on subjects you are writing 
about to help you form your own view of the subject. The information 
could be from electronic journals, technical reports, unpublished 
dissertations, etc. Make a note of the source of every piece of 
information at the time you record it, even if it is just one sentence.</li>
<li>Don't construct a piece of work by cutting and pasting or copying 
material written by other people, or by you for any other purpose, into 
something you are submitting as your own work. Sometimes you may need to
 quote someone else's exact form of words in order to analyse or 
criticise them, in which case the quotation must be enclosed in 
quotation marks to show that it is a direct quote, and it must have the 
source properly acknowledged at that point. Any omissions from a 
quotation must be indicated by an ellipsis and any additions for clarity
 must be enclosed in square brackets, e.g. [These] results suggest that 
the hypothesis is correct. It may also be appropriate to reproduce a 
diagram from someone else's work, but again the source must be 
explicitly and fully acknowledged there. However, constructing large 
chunks of documents from a string of quotes, even if they are 
acknowledged, is another form of plagiarism.</li>
<li>Do attribute all ideas to their original authors. Written ideas are 
the product that authors produce. You would not appreciate it if other 
people passed off your ideas as their own, and that is what plagiarism 
rules are intended to prevent. A good rule of thumb is that each idea or
 statement that you write should be attributed to a source unless it is 
your personal idea or it is common knowledge. (If you are unsure if 
something is common knowledge, ask other students: if they don't know 
what you are talking about, then it is not common knowledge!)</li>
</ol>
<p>You should note that a quote in quotation marks, either indented or 
not, is not plagiarism as long as you cite its source. Further, it will 
not be included in the 250 words (details coming up) and neither will 
the citation or the references.</p>
<h3 id="submissions">Your Submission <a href="#toc" title="return to contents" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></h3>
<p>As we have already seen 30% of the assessment structure for this unit
 is made up from the three coursework components based on our discussion
 topics. These discussion topics are provided to help you form your 
opinion about a certain aspect of the course which needs closer 
inspection, while at the same time teaching you how to read, summarise, 
and critique<sup><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5">5</a></sup> a piece of work such that you can form your own opinions about that work.</p>
<p>You should submit all 250 word (plus or minus 10% or 25 words) 
coursework assignments via Blackboard. These will be checked for length 
and plagiarism via the Turn-It-In system; after which point they will be
 graded. You will receive feedback and grades within two weeks of the 
submission deadline. I am strict on hand-ins -- no exceptions and no 
exemptions. Remember you can complete all coursework as soon as you like
 -- the deadlines are your last possible chance to submit.</p>

<p>Remember, No exceptions, No exemptions! The printer will be busy -- 
this is not an excuse -- you don't need to print; if the power goes off 
or the computer explodes -- this is not an excuse -- back-ups. If your 
Hamster dies in a horrible 'seed-choking' accident -- this is not an 
excuse. You haven't got a dog -- it cannot chew your answers. And no, 
your USB pen has not been abducted by aliens! If you get hit by a bus; 
suffer a gruesome chain-saw accident; are attacked by a loose buffalo 
along Oxford Road I may be lenient. Finally, remember No Plagiarism, 
both the School and University take plagiarism very seriously.</p>

<h3 id="assignments">Your assignments are: <a href="#toc" title="return to contents" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">'Understanding, Scoping and Defining User Experience: A Survey Approach'[<a href="#Law-2009">Law et al., 2009</a>]
 (10 Marks) -- this work will enable you to understand the scope and the
 inconsistencies still present within the UX domain. It will enable you 
to understand that the definition of UX is not yet fixed and is someway 
based on the interpretation of the practitioner;</p></li>
<li><p class="">'Designing the Star User Interface' [<a href="#XeroxStar1982">Smith et al., 1982</a>]
 (10 Marks) -- the Star interface is really where all GUI interfaces 
began. It takes the user as a first and primary priority in the design 
and it is inconceivable that you do not have an awareness of these 
classic design principles as perspective computer science graduates; and</p></li>
<li><p class="">'Voice Loops as Cooperative Aids in Space Shuttle Mission Control' [<a href="#Watts1996">Watts et al., 1996</a>]
 (10 Marks) -- this paper shows just how far UX and the techniques which
 it inherits from human computer interaction can go. We are mainly 
concerned with systems and objects which are purely commercial, however,
 in this case failures in the human interface can have serious 
consequences for a real-time mission, including the loss of the vehicle.
 Further, these kind of UX techniques can also be found in other 
critical interface components such as those controlling nuclear power 
stations or fly-by-wire aircraft.</p></li>

<p>So the 'question' that you need to answer for each of the three assignments is that which is asked of UX'ers in most companies.</p>
<p>The questions from managers often are phrased thus:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>'Tell me why this paper is important?'</li>
<li>'What should I know and why is it important?'</li>
<li>'How does this paper affect our development?'</li>
<li>'What insights does the paper have and how does it affect us?'</li>
<li>'Can we use this paper to our advantage?'</li>
</ol>
<p>So the skill is to be able to summarise a paper while also adding in 
your expertise and original thought - coming up with 250 words (the 
industry standard) of insight which someone without your training in UX 
or CS could not produce.</p>
<p>You interpret the paper, add your insight (using experience created 
from your UX/CS training), and produce a 'mash-up' of the two focusing 
on aspects of the paper you think are important, rationalising why, and 
linking it to other work you have read, work you have done or seen, 
prior knowledge, or real world experience.</p>
<p>It is difficult to not just produce a summary (but a summary is often
 never required). Think to yourself, what do I bring to this 250 words 
(± 10%), could anyone have created the 250 words (± 10%) by just reading
 the paper and without your training and insight. If the answer to the 
last question is 'yes' then you need to change adding your insight based
 on your expertise.</p>
<h3 id="subs">Submitting Your Work <a href="#toc" title="return to contents" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></h3>
<p>You should submit all 250 word (± 10%) coursework assignments via 
Blackboard. These will be checked for length and plagiarism via the 
Turn-It-In system; after which point they will be graded. You will 
receive feedback and grades within two weeks of the submission deadline.
 I am strict on hand-ins -- no exceptions and no exemptions. Remember 
you can complete all coursework as soon as you like -- the deadlines are
 your last possible chance to submit.</p>

<h3 id="why-250-words">Why 250 words? (± 10%) <a href="#toc" title="return to contents" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></h3>
<p>Students tell me that when trying to write the coursework they 
constantly find that 250 words is completely insufficient to properly 
make any point that they would like to make about the paper that they 
have read. They are not suggesting that these be made into 1000 word 
essays as that would just be unfair and way too much work. They do 
however suggest that perhaps the guideline length to 250-500 words with a
 10% tolerance at either end meaning an overall length of between 225 
and 550 words would be better. They think this would allow for some more
 in depth observations without the pressure of such a low word limit as 
it often doesn't seem right to make two to three (perhaps flimsy, due to
 the word cap) points and to sum your opinions all in the space of 225 
to 275 words.</p>
<p>I quite understand their point; 250 words is very short. However, you
 may have guessed by now that I don't do very much without a reason. So 
the reason why it is 250 words is simple - this is the industry 
standard. You need to be able to summarise in 250 words - and I fear 
you've not been exposed to this in CS up to now. Remember, you don't 
need to say everything - you need to pick out the most important stuff 
based on your experience. It may be tough now - but you'll be expected 
to write it in 250 words in business - and I'd rather this occurs now 
and you don't have to learn within a company settings. If you don't 
believe me have a look at the ACM DL for abstracts - it's the same for 
all Science, Engineering, and Medical domains - 250 words.</p>
<p>You should note that a quote in quotation marks, either indented or 
not, is not plagiarism as long as you cite its source. Further, it will 
not be included in the 250 words and neither will the citation or the 
references.</p>

<h2 id="rubric">Marking Rubric <a href="#toc" title="return to contents" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></h2>
<p>Your submission will be marked according to the following rubric, which has three components marked from A--E:</p>
<ul>
<li>STRUCTURE &amp; ARGUMENT (35%) -- How you introduce, develop, and conclude your argument.

<h2 id="marking">Teaching Assistant Marking Instructions <a href="#toc" title="return to contents" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></h2>
<p>Students have been asked to discuss each of the following papers and 
make 250 word submissions for each, according to the timetable , and 
based on the rubric you will use to mark them.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li class="">'Understanding, Scoping and Defining User Experience: A Survey Approach'[<a href="#Law-2009">Law et al., 2009</a>]
 (10 Marks) -- this work will enable you to understand the scope and the
 inconsistencies still present within the UX domain. It will enable you 
to understand that the definition of UX is not yet fixed and is someway 
based on the interpretation of the practitioner;</li>
<li>'Designing the Star User Interface' [<a href="#XeroxStar1982">Smith et al., 1982</a>]
 (10 Marks) -- the Star interface is really where all GUI interfaces 
began. It takes the user as a first and primary priority in the design 
and it is inconceivable that you do not have an awareness of these 
classic design principles as perspective computer science graduates; and</li>
<li>'Voice Loops as Cooperative Aids in Space Shuttle Mission Control' [<a href="#Watts1996">Watts et al., 1996</a>]
 (10 Marks) -- this paper shows just how far UX and the techniques which
 it inherits from human computer interaction can go. We are mainly 
concerned with systems and objects which are purely commercial, however,
 in this case failures in the human interface can have serious 
consequences for a real-time mission, including the loss of the vehicle.
 Further, these kind of UX techniques can also be found in other 
critical interface components such as those controlling nuclear power 
stations or fly-by-wire aircraft.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="we-have-two-weeks...">We Have Two Weeks...</h3>
<p>to turn around feedback for each submission, with a final feedback deadline two weeks after the coursework submission deadline.</p>
<p>You will need to have read each paper, and formed your own opinions 
about it before marking the work. The objective is not to slavishly 
follow a set template but to make sure the students know the content of 
the work, and understand that content in enough detail to form a 
critical opinion of that work. As there are no boolean right of wrong 
answers the marking of each abstract will take longer than a 
conventional marking process; but this will, hopefully, give us better 
learning outcomes than parrot-fashion (thought free) assessments.</p>
<p>Each submission will be submitted to the Turn-It-In Plagiarism 
checker - if there are signs of repetition of: phraseology, ideas, or 
the like - beyond that which we could normally expect - when we will 
define this as plagiarised work. In this case you should alert me.</p>
<p>If you have any questions on any work as you are marking it then 
please forward them to me as soon as possible - so that we can maintain 
our two week target for feedback.</p>
<h3 id="feedback">Feedback <a href="#toc" title="return to contents" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></h3>
<p>The feedback for this work should not just be via the grade, but 
written and informative enough for the students to understand their 
mistakes and derive some beneficial learning experience from the 
feedback -- so as to make their exam work better. The 'Grade-mark' 
system will be used with the rubric providing the more universal 
comments, then general comments entered into the system, and finally any
 quick comments and off-the-shelf remarks dragging to the relevant 
position in the text. The students should be able to get to all this 
information, but after marking each assignment we need to download the 
pdf feedback form and email it to each student.</p>
<h3 id="exemplars">Exemplars <a href="#toc" title="return to contents" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Student 1 with no citations:</strong> A definition for 
User Experience (UX) is difficult. It's a new area and people's own 
agenda influences their views on it. Industry people believe it's about 
the users' experience as a whole and their view of the company/brand and
 answering the simple question 'Does it do what they want'. Whereas 
academics take into account the users emotional state, the complexity of
 the system and the situation they are using it in. The article sets out
 an important definition, that by UX we refer to the use of a particular
 product/service, not an overall experience of a company/brand. User 
Experience is subjective, we are all different and prefer different 
things, but maybe not completely subjective, for example, computer 
scientists are likely to find a command line interface acceptable. 
However an art student would prefer a more graphical interface. This 
would suggest we can group users into social communities. Experts would 
agree with this as the survey suggested they feel it's not subjective 
and I can understand this as we are all human and have similarities., 
such as we make mistakes, so being able to recover from them, would be a
 good aspect of an experience. So maybe to some extent we can apply a 
template to UX. It's interesting to think of UX not just as the time it 
occurs, but before and after. This thinking could lead to a better UX. 
Maybe UX is not an exact science and not a completely subjective either,
 but somewhere in between, with interesting avenues still to explore and
 that in its self will be an experience.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Student 2 - with external pointers citations:</strong> It
 is clear that the research in this paper aimed not only to collate the 
opinions among academia and industry to agree on a definition of UX, but
 to also measure their participant's responses and attitudes towards 
finding a definition. The paper appears to conclude that the work 
carried out by the researchers will be of benefit towards defining UX, 
outlining the nature of UX being one of an abstract, subjective and 
emotive area, though these objectives appear to somewhat contradict with
 their findings. For instance, their research found that most 
respondents disagree with there existing a 'definite need for a 
standardised definition of the term UX' 
(http://www.awebsite.com/whatimciting). As the research aims to assist 
work in creating a definition, this mood amongst industry and academia 
indicates to me that there are many interpretations of UX and perhaps 
these variations lead to a reluctance among practitioners to compromise 
on their own understanding in favour of an objective and fixed 
definition. Another example of this variation exists from the 
geographical differences<sup>1</sup> in attitude which is briefly 
highlighted in the paper's conclusions, adding to the subjective nature 
not only of UX, but it's understanding in HCI community globally. 
Perhaps in order to better define UX we should be aware of it's 
subjective nature arid allow this very new area of work to develop free 
from the constraints of definitions and objectivity to lead to a more 
fluid and flexible domain similar to the dynamic effects it produces in 
users.</p><p>1. &nbsp;http://www.anotherwebsite.com/whatimciting</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Student 3 with informal citations:</strong> The paper 
attempts to define User Experience (UX) by presenting the perceptions of
 a wide range of people on a wide range of statements and potential 
definitions for UX. It fails to acknowledge that coming to a consensus 
on the scope of UX would require coming to a consensus of the 
definitions of 'user' and 'experience'. The paper instead focuses on 
some factors that contribute to the generation of an experience, and 
some characteristics of a user<sup>1</sup>. The factors and 
characteristics are secondary to the supposed problem; what is a user, 
and what is an experience? Furthermore, what is a good experience? One 
could argue that any experience must be had by some thing, and that this
 thing„ by experiencing something, is consequently a user. Does 
overgrowth provide a good UX for a crumbling building in a forest, in 
that it prolongs the structural integrity of the building, or vice 
versa, because buildings aren't alive? Furthermore, the purported 
advantages of having a universal definition for UX are instead the 
advantages of having a definition of good UX (which is hopeless). Issues
 with the discourse, evaluation and teaching of UX originate from the 
subjective question of what makes good UX, but not what UX is [1]; these
 problems are not unique to the field. The paper also fails to 
acknowledge the benefits that come from UX having a dynamic scope and 
definition, such as allowing interdisciplinary approaches to problems 
[Various 2015], enhanced versatility and applicability, and future 
malleability. Any universal definition of UX would be so general as to 
be useless.</p><p>1. &nbsp;http://www.anotherwebsite.com/whatimciting Accessed 01 Jun 2015.</p><p><strong>References</strong><br>[1] Various, 2015, ITV News 12 http://www.anotherwebsite.com/whatimciting Accessed 01 Jan  2017.<br>[Various 2015] Various, 2015, BBC News 24 http://www.anotherwebsite.com/whatimciting Accessed 01 Jun  2017.<br></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Student 4 with formal references:</strong> There is no 
definitive way to classify UX [Brown 2013]-- it is a challenging concept
 to render. We see that our job is to uncover the semantics of 
interactions between the user and system, as to allow for better user 
experience. That is, what do we need to do to make sure user 
satisfaction is maximised? I comprehend its difficult because they're 
elements to UX which we can't easily determine and therefore transform 
into a 'working model', which tells us how we should stimulate the 
user's attention fully. Users' perception of a system can be down to 
personal subjectivity, determined by a series of individual emotions and
 sensations. Perception can also be influenced by social contexts' 
they're in; different communities of people which affect their 
experience. It's clear that different people (practitioners, scholars 
etc.) in fields relating to UX have various ideologies as to what UX is.
 Taking a range of different perceptions and gathering them carefully 
into a unified definition is one approach to solving this problem. 
Trying to map qualitative information (open definitions) of what people 
understand about UX into quantitative information (statistical 
information) may give rise into helping define what UX is [1]. I don't 
believe this is trivial as people's apprehensions are subjective, and 
could be very difficult to find an adequate scope to cover all possible 
areas of UX. We do know, however, that the very concept is dynamic which
 stems from individual human responses, and involvement in varying 
social contexts', to the use of an artefact.</p><p><strong>References</strong><br>Brown

<li><p><strong>Student 5 with quotation (Quotations in quote marks and 
indented are no plagiarism as long as they are cited, and are not 
counted in the word count):</strong> This paper offers an informative 
insight into the thoughts and views on UX from both academics, and 
people working within this domain in industry. The results of this paper
 show that in some areas, both academia and industry are 'agreed', and 
in others their views differ somewhat. The real challenge appears to be 
the ability to find a 'consensual definition of UX.</p>
	<blockquote>
	"The much vaunted Web 2.0 sees once static pages evolving into hybrid 
applications. Content that was once simple to surf is now becoming 
increasingly complicated due to the many areas of dynamic content 
"dotted" throughout the page. In previous studies, we have shown that 
unlike younger users, older users have more varied interaction patterns 
when using dynamic content." -- Lunn 2011
	</blockquote><br>
<p>The survey approach used in this paper shows that whilst all parties 
seem to agree that a definition is needed, it also shows that there are 
several variables to take into account, not all of which seem to have 
the same weighting of importance to each individual. This shows is that 
finding an 'ultimate' definition is going to be challenging and will not
 satisfy everyone's ideals. In order to create a shared definition, we 
must first consider the 'emotional, affective, experiential, hedonic, 
and aesthetic' [1] variables governing the concept of UX We must also 
clarify what exactly we are defining, for example, is it a single aspect
 of an application, or is it the usability of the full system. Only once
 these have been addressed., can a shared definition be put forward. I 
feel that several definitions will be required in order to satisfy all 
the 'criteria' (a definition for various single aspects as well as a 
definition for a full system). Due to the varied nature of applications,
 it seems to me that if a shared definition were to be agreed on, then 
it would need to be relatively 'vague', so as to be applicable for the 
majority of applications. [1] Understanding, scoping and defining user 
experience: a survey approach.</p>

<li><p><strong>Student 6 with no citations:</strong> There exists vast 
ambiguity when precisely defining the User Experience domain. The paper 
attempts to address this issue through knowledge elicitation involving 
industry/academic professionals. A survey formalised responses, 
answering questions covering definitions, opinions and respondents' 
background. Statistical analysis was then used to highlight patterns in 
an attempt to derive an accurate definition. This is important due to 
the current disparity in describing what is UX? Currently the UX domain 
encompasses everything from the explicit end-user interactions with a 
company/system to the tacit emotions elicited through reflection. Within
 this scope the research highlighted a geographic divide in opinion on 
the 'subjectivity' of UX, describing disagreements on the importance of 
user perception over performance. These results indicate fundamentally 
different approaches to UX within the USA and Europe further 
strengthening the argument for standardisation. Interestingly, although 
many of the background variables proved fruitless, there existed an 
inverse proportionality between the need for standardisation and an 
individual's level of expertise. Indicating the value in a precise 
definition would most benefit those who are inexperienced within the UX 
field. Clearly there is widespread ambiguity in defining UX within the 
community. The recommendation is to impose constraints on the domain to 
establish a definition based upon user-interface interactions, which 
places general experiences out of scope. Reining in what UX encompasses 
will benefit the field, allowing for focused research on 'measurable 
aspects' to drive innovation. Reflecting, it is clear I have come to 
appreciate the significance in scope and temporal properties that 
contribute to the 'user experience'. Accentuating that UX reaches far 
deeper than simply a cognitive process.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>My Attempt:</strong>
I understand that it may be difficult to realise just exactly what I 
would like from your 250 word discussions. In this case I think an 
example is appropriate, and I have chosen a very famous human factors 
research paper, written in the mid--Fifties and concerning 
Psychoacoustics -- 'The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some 
Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information' [<a href="#mil56">Miller, 1956</a>].
 This paper is interesting because it has spawned, an often incorrectly 
understood, usability principle -- being that our working memory can 
only handle seven (±) items at any one time and therefore we should only
 make menus or lists a maximum of seven items long. Here is my 
discussion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a name="p-dtexample">"Miller's</a> paper is a summary/analysis of 
research findings couched in the form of bits per channel. He amusingly,
 relates the fact that the number seven seems to be plaguing his every 
move because seven seems to appear repeatedly in regard to the amount of
 information that can be remembered or differentiated by humans. However
 there are two caveats to this assertion: firstly, that the user is 
required to make absolute judgements of uni-dimensional stimuli and 
secondly that that stimuli is not clustered. This last point is quite 
important because using clustering means that we can remember or 
distinguish more than the unitary seven. For instance, we can remember 
seven characters in sequence, seven words in order, or seven phrases. In
 reality then, we have trouble differentiating uni-dimensional stimuli 
such as audible tones played without reference to each other, but we can
 differentiate more than seven tones when played in a sequence, or 
separately when multiple dimensions such as loudness and pitch are 
varied. Further, we are able to remember more then seven things within a
 list especially if those things are related or can be judged 
relatively, or occur as part of a sequence. So the well found 
psychological finding that working memory can handle seven (±2) 
arbitrarily sized chunks of absolute uni-dimensional stimuli, becomes 
the often quoted but mostly incorrect usability/HCI principle that you 
should only include seven items in a menu, or seven items in a list... 
and on and on."</p>

<h2 id="outcomes">Learning Outcomes <a href="#toc" title="return to contents" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></h2>
<p>Once you've completed this course you will have covered a number of 
School/University stipulated learning outcomes. These count towards your
 final degree:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>A2/A3/A5:</strong> Have an understanding of the domain, 
concepts, and important and upcoming aspects of UX along with aspects of
 user interaction and cognition. In particular to have an understanding 
of the importance of Standards, Technologies, and Guidelines in the 
process;</li>
<li><strong>C4:</strong> Have an understanding of relevant methods 
including experiment design, application, and the ethical issues 
surrounding such a design;</li>
<li><strong>A1/D6:</strong> Have an understanding of, and be able to 
select and apply, the relevant descriptive statistical tests associated 
with UX Engineering;</li>
<li><strong>B1/C4:</strong> Be able to analyse and critique UX work, experimental studies, and computer interfaces; and</li>
<li><strong>B3/C4:</strong> Use analysis techniques associated with 
their knowledge of the domain to understand the problems associated with
 different designs, and suggests solutions for their resolution.</li>
</ol>
<p>Learning outcomes are variously assessed by Examination (70%) and Coursework (30%):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>A1/A2/A3/A5/B3/C2/C4/D6:</strong> Examination;</li>
<li><strong>B1/C4:</strong> Coursework - papers and texts will serve as 
discussion topics which will give rise to concise 200 word essays 
analysing and/or critiquing the topic under discussion -- an 
understanding of the most important topics which arise from these 
analysis will also be tested via Examination.</li>
</ol>
<div><hr></div>
<h2 id="assessment">Assessment <a href="#toc" title="return to contents" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></h2>
<p>As we have already seen 30% of the assessment structure for this unit
 is made up from the three coursework components, the remaining 70% is 
from the final examination. This examination will be 1h:30m long and 
will be in two parts. The first part will be composed of 10 compulsory 
multiple-choice questions (no negative marking); while the second part 
will be a choice of five/six longer questions again compulsory. The 
questions on the second part will require longer answers and will be 
made up of sub questions; with the topics drawn randomly from the unit 
book. This method has served well over the last few years giving 
averages of 60% inline with differences from the students average 
performance of 1.3.</p>
<p>The structure of both parts will comprise: bookwork; discussions (and
 examples); application of technique; and original thought. You will not
 be able to attain a first (over 70%) without being able to demonstrate 
your ability to apply original thought to a problem, and you will not be
 able to achieve an upper second class (2:1, 60%) without being able to 
demonstrate a good grasp of the application of various techniques.</p>
<p>In a break with the tradition let us look at the kinds of questions 
you will be expected to answer when it comes to the completion of this 
exam:</p>

<h3>The Importance of Taking Notes!</h3>
<p>In 2003, Rob Howard <a title="To the original" href="http://grokable.com/2003/04/post-billg-review/">described a meeting with Bill Gates</a></p>
<p>The first thing I notice as the meeting starts is that Bill is 
left-handed. He also didn’t bring a computer in with him, but instead is
 taking notes on a yellow pad of paper. I had heard this before – Bill 
takes amazingly detailed notes during meetings. I image he has to, given
 all the information directed at him. The other thing I noticed during 
the course of the meeting is how he takes his notes. He doesn’t take 
notes from top-to-bottom, but rather logically divides the page into 
quadrants, each reserved for a different thought. For example, it 
appeared that all his questions were placed at the bottom of the page.</p>
